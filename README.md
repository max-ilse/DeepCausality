# DeepCausality
This is an attempt to stay on top of the ever increasing number of papers that combine flexible neural function approximators (aka neural networks) and causality research. I tried to organize the papers into a small number of categories. Some papers are part of multiple categories. If you happen to come across this list and want me to add a paper please send me a pull request.

# Determine the cause-effect relationship (does x causes y or y causes x?)

# A causal view on deep learning methods

# Estimating the treatment effect from observational data

# Combining interventional and observational data

# Generating counterfactuals

# Domain adaptation and generalisation

# Meta Learning and causality
